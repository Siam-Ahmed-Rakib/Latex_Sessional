# Latex_Sessional

This repository contains all the work I completed as part of the Latex Sessional course during my Undergraduate Level 2, Term 2. The course aims to develop essential skills in formal research writing, effective presentations, and technical documentation using LaTeX. Below is an overview of the three main components of the course, represented as folders in this repository:

1. [Paper Reproduction Assignment](https://github.com/Siam-Ahmed-Rakib/Latex_Sessional/tree/main/Paper%20Reproduction%20Assignment)  
This folder contains the work done for reproducing a research paper using LaTeX. The assignment focused on replicating the structure, formatting, and content of a published paper as a home task. It served as an excellent opportunity to learn the nuances of academic writing and typesetting using LaTeX.

2. [Online Assignment](https://github.com/Siam-Ahmed-Rakib/Latex_Sessional/tree/main/Online%20Assignment)  
This folder includes tasks completed during lab sessions. The assignments involved replicating tables, figures, mathematical expressions, and other document elements using LaTeX. 

3. [Presentation](https://github.com/Siam-Ahmed-Rakib/Latex_Sessional/tree/main/Presentation)  
This folder contains a presentation slide created using Beamer and TikZ, completed as a team effort with Alif and Hamim. The presentation was delivered to a mass audience and was designed to develop presentation skills alongside technical proficiency in LaTeX for slide preparation.

Each folder in this repository also contains its own README file that provides a more detailed explanation of the respective tasks and outputs.
